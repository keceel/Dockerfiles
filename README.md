Docker Images containing hundreds of my published tools and the supporting technologies to run full functional test suites.

##### Contains 45 repos with 340+ tags, many different versions of standard official open source software, see [Full Inventory](https://github.com/HariSekhon/Dockerfiles#full-inventory) futher down.

Summarily this repo contains:

* **Hadoop & Big Data** ecosystem technologies (Spark, Kafka, Presto, Drill, Nifi, ZooKeeper)
* **NoSQL** datastores (HBase, Cassandra, Riak, SolrCloud)
* OS & development images (Alpine, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu)
* **DevOps** tech, anything cool and open source (RabbitMQ Cluster, Mesos, Consul)
* [My GitHub repos](https://github.com/HariSekhon) containing hundreds of tools related to these technologies with all dependencies pre-built

These images are all available pre-built on [My DockerHub - https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/](https://hub.docker.com/u/harisekhon/).

**Quality and Testing** - this repo has entire suites of tests run against it from various [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/HariSekhon) to validate the docker images functionality, branches vs tagged versions align, syntax checks against build files and various configuration file formats (ini/json/xml) etc - these are reusable tests that can anybody can reuse for their own repos and can be found in my [PyTools](https://github.com/HariSekhon/pytools) and [Bash-Tools](https://github.com/HariSekhon/bash-tools) repos as well as the [Advanced Nagios Plugins Collection](https://github.com/HariSekhon/nagios-plugins) which contains hundreds of technology specific API-level test programs. This is never 100% but is an always ongoing process, and they are tested via Continuous Integration for various repos that use them for their test suites as well. All of this is intended to keep the qualify of this repo high.

### Ready to run Docker images

```
docker search harisekhon
docker run harisekhon/nagios-plugins
```

To see more than the 25 DockerHub repos limited by ```docker search``` ([docker issue 23055](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/23055)) I wrote ```dockerhub_search.py``` using the DockerHub API, available in my [PyTools github repo](https://github.com/harisekhon/pytools) and as a pre-built docker image:

```
docker run harisekhon/pytools dockerhub_search.py harisekhon
```

There are lots of tagged versions of official software in my repos to allow development testing across multiple versions, usually more versions than available from the official repos (and new version updates available on request, just [raise a GitHub issue](https://github.com/harisekhon/Dockerfiles/issues)).

DockerHub tags are not shown by ```docker search``` ([docker issue 17238](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/17238)) so I wrote ```dockerhub_show_tags.py``` available in my [PyTools github repo](https://github.com/harisekhon/pytools) and as a pre-built docker image - eg. to see an organized list of all tags for the official CentOS & Ubuntu repos dynamically using the DockerHub API:

```
docker run harisekhon/pytools dockerhub_show_tags.py centos ubuntu
```

(you might need to add --timeout 60 as ubuntu has a lot of tags now I've noticed to stop it timing out while fetching all the pages)

For service technologies like Hadoop, HBase, ZooKeeper etc for which you'll also want port mappings, each directory in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/harisekhon/dockerfiles) contains both a standard ` docker-compose ` configuration as well as a ` make run ` shortcut (which doesn't require ` docker-compose ` to be installed) - either way you don't have to remember all the command line switches and port number specifics:

```
cd zookeeper
docker-compose up
```

or for technologies with interactive shells like Spark, ZooKeeper, HBase, Drill, Cassandra where you want to be dropped in to an interactive shell, use the ` make run ` shortcut instead:

```
cd zookeeper
make run
```

which is much easier to type and remember than the equivalent bigger commands like:

```
docker run -ti -p 2181:2181 harisekhon/zookeeper
```

which gets much worse for more complex services like Hadoop / HBase:

```
docker run -ti -p 2181:2181 -p 8080:8080 -p 8085:8085 -p 9090:9090 -p 9095:9095 -p 16000:16000 -p 16010:16010 -p 16201:16201 -p 16301:16301 harisekhon/hbase
```

```
docker run -ti -p 8020:8020 -p 8032:8032 -p 8088:8088 -p 9000:9000 -p 10020:10020 -p 19888:19888 -p 50010:50010 -p 50020:50020 -p 50070:50070 -p 50075:50075 -p 50090:50090 harisekhon/hadoop
```
